Meeting with Kate / Jimmy / Steve
2 Feb 2017

Decided to stop trying differential gene expression analysis because visual genes likely too lowly expressed in skin tissue to be significant for edgeR analysis. 
Jenna / Jules to try Gfold and GO enrichment. If that doesn't work then give it a rest.
Instead focus on on 'descriptive' results, e.g. what genes are present/absent for each organ? 
FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million) is a good descriptive measure within a sample, whereas TPM/CPM (Transcripts/Counts Per Million) are good for statistically comparason among samples.
We will use FPKM.

Things to do:
1) Reassemble "all_tissues_contigs" (de nova assembly for reference sequence) using mRNA reads from eye (Jenna and Jules can do this)
2) Use Jules' interpro-scan script to annotate the new all_tissues_contigs (Jules and Jimmy can do this)
3) Use hisat2 to align reads from each organ to refenence (Jenna and Jimmy can do this)
4) Visualise alignment using IGV (Jenna can do this)
5) Use counts table (or bam file?) from hisat2 output in rsem for quantification (FPKM) (Jenna can do this!)
6) Visualise results of rsem using heatmap of FPKM of candidate visual genes (Jenna needs help making heatmaps! Maybe Steve can help with this?)
7) Can also create gene profiling for all organs (separated into quartiles, with FPKM at cut-off levels) (something for Jenna, Jimmy and Steve, I think)

Sweet!
