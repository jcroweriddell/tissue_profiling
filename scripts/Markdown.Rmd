# Say hello to R Markdown
Markdown is an **easy to use** format for writing reports. *Without realising it*. 

THis is a list

* [Github](www.github.com)
* something else

Now it's time for some code

```{r}
2+2
```
Exclude code from the final report like so:

```{r eval=FALSE}
2+2
```
It's particularly useful for displaying plots without all that messy code
```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
hist(x)
```



This is how you embed R code in line with text. Two plus two equals `r 2+2`
